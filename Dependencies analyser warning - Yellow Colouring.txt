=======FIXED
Dependencies analyser warning - with Yellow Colouring

====Solution
I've had the same issue. I think its because of the "C:\Program Files\dotnet" folder perssion. 
you can open the visual studio by Run as Administrator or give the folder all permission in security folder.
I did it and my proplem was resolved.
