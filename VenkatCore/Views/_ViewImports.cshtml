@*  After a while I figured out the silly issue.
    The following statement should NOT have a semicolon at the end and I had one!  *@

@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers




@*  Injecting a service to View .... Like Controller Injection  *@
@*  These services now available to all views *@

@inject IEmployeeRepository _employeeRepository
@inject IDepartmentRepository _departmentRepository
@*
    you can also use _ViewImports to register tag helpers, and the @inject attribute also works from _ViewImports.
    The namespaces and injected properties are available for every view in the Views folder, and all child folders.
